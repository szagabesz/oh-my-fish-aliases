Description
-----------

This is a repository which contains a few frequently used aliases and typo fixes for day-to-day work.

Installation
------------
1. First, you need to have a fish with oh-my-fish installed. Check http://fish.sh and https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish for further steps.
2. Checkout my repository to somewhere you like, ie. ~/oh-my-aliases (`cd ~; git clone https://github.com/technodelight/oh-my-fish-aliases.git`)
3. `cd ~/oh-my-aliases; ./install.sh` Note that the install script requires `fish` to be installed properly.

You can place the repository to wherever you like it with specifying the second (directory) parameter to the `git clone` like `git clone https://github.com/technodelight/oh-my-fish-aliases.git /whatever/directory/you/want/to/place/it`.
